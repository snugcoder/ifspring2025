            of the pasta makes a world of difference.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>

            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water). Add
            the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Heat the oil in a deep 12-inch skillet or pot over medium. Add the pancetta,
            if using, and fry until crispy, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red-pepper
            flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat to
            medium-low, add the vodka and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.

            <h4>Step 3</h4>

            Stir in the tomatoes and then fill the can halfway with water and swish it around to loosen up any leftover
            tomatoes; add a quarter to half of the water to the pan. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10
            minutes, and season with salt and pepper. If you prefer your sauce a little looser, go ahead and add the
            remaining water and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to low, add the cream and cook, stirring, until
            the sauce becomes an even pinkish-rust color, about 1 minute.

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            Stir in the cooked pasta and Â¼ cup cheese; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among
            bowls, top with additional cheese, if desired, and sprinkle with the oregano and parsley.</p>

Even though they have ads on their webpage, the ads don't disrupt the users readibility of the content on the page. I also like the layout used on each individual recipe page.

However, I do think that the logo is slightly too big. I also think that the website could benefit from a button that sends users directly to the recipe without having to scroll through all the content.

I also like the minimalistic design.
